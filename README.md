# Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions

This project implements anomaly detection techniques on the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Download the Dataset

1. Go to the Kaggle dataset page: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
2. Sign in to your Kaggle account (or create one if you don't have an account).
3. Click on the "Download" button to download the dataset as a ZIP file.
4. Extract the ZIP file, and place the `creditcard.csv` file in the project directory.
